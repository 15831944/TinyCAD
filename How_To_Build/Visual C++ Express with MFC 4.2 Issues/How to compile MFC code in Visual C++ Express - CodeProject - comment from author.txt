Hi Ron,

If you have a VC++ 6 installed, you can use that instead of the DDK.

Follow the instructions in the article, but where it tells you to add the "$(DDK_directory)\inc\mfc42" directory, use the "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\MFC\Include" folder instead. Same goes for the other include and lib directories (e.g., "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\MFC\Lib" for the lib).

You do not need to install the DDK. Also you can build and run in debug mode, when you have the original VC++ 6 installed.

kind regards,
Danny
