<p><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Drawing Toolbar
reference</span></b></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Delete Item</span></b></p>

<p>This option allow you to delete objects in the design.</p>

<p>To delete an item first select the Edit Item tool. Select the item to delete
by clicking on it with the left mouse button. The object will turn grey to
indicate it has been selected. You may instead of selecting a single item with
the edit tool select a group of items. These too may be deleted.</p>

<p>Now select this option on the toolbar menu to delete the item.</p>

<p>You may undo the deletion by using the undo option in the edit menu. </p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Edit Item</span></b></p>

<p>This option enables editing of objects already placed in the design. You may
also use this tool to move objects in your design and to delete objects in your
design.</p>

<p>Once this option has been selected then clicking with the left mouse button
on an object in the design will select that object. To show it has been
selected it will be shown in light grey.</p>

<p>If there is more than one editable object under the mouse pointer, then
clicking again with the left mouse button in the same place will cause a
different object to be selected. Keep clicking with the left mouse button until
the object you wish to edit is selected.</p>

<p>If the object is editable, then a dialogue box associated with the object
will be shown enabling you to change it. For example, if you click on a text
object then a dialogue box will appear with the text in it. You may then change
the text in the dialogue box.</p>

<p>End editing an object by clicking with the right mouse button in the design
window, or by selecting a new object to edit using the left mouse button.</p>

<p>You may also move objects that are selected. To do this hold down the left
mouse button on a selected object. Now move the mouse, with the left mouse button
held down. The object will be moved with the mouse. To finish release the left
mouse button.</p>

<p>You may delete any selected object by using the delete item option on the
toolbar.</p>

<p>You may copy any selected object to the clipboard by selecting the Copy or
Cut options in the edit menu. Once a selection has been copied to the clipboard
it may be pasted into another application (such as <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Microsoft</st1:PersonName>
Word), or pasted back into the design.</p>

<p>To select groups of objects you may drag a rectangle around the objects to
be selected. Any object within the rectangle will be selected. Once it has been
selected you may delete, move, copy or cut the object. To drag the rectangle,
place the pointer in an area of the design where there is no object. Hold down
the left mouse button and move the mouse. The rectangle will be created.
Release the left mouse button to select the objects within the rectangle.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Junction</span></b></p>

<p>Junctions are normally automatically placed for you. You do not need to use
this tool.</p>

<p>Junctions indicate when two wires meet that they are electrically joined.
This information is used by the special tools to generate net lists and check
the electrical rules. When two wires meet or cross it is assumed they are not
joined unless a junction is placed at the crossing point.</p>

<p>To place a junction select this option, then move the junction to the
location in the design where you wish to place it and then click with the left
mouse button. When you have finished placing, either select a new tool or click
with the right mouse button. This will select the Edit Item in the Edit menu
for you.</p>

<p>Junctions cannot be edited, but they can be moved or deleted.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Label</span></b></p>

<p>Labels indicate a connection to the wire which runs beneath them. Any two
wires with the same label name above them are considered to be connected.</p>

<p>This can be useful when two parts of a circuit need to be connected but are
a long way apart on the diagram, or one point needs to be connected to a large
number of others.</p>

<p>It is often required to have bars over the letters in the label. This can be
done by placing the ` character before each letter that needs a bar over it. If
a whole word needs to have a bar placed over it then each letter in that word
must have a ` before it.</p>

<p>Type the text you wish to add in the dialogue box. As you enter text a
rectangle will appear next to the mouse, indicating the size and position of
the text.</p>

<p>Move this rectangle with the mouse to where you wish to place it and click
with the left hand button.</p>

<p>After placing a label, if the text has a number on the end of it, it is
automatically incremented or decremented depending on the Name Increment or
Name Decrement option selected in the Repeat Directions menu (in the Edit
menu).</p>

<p>You can cancel entering text by clicking with the right mouse button.</p>

<p>Labels can be edited once placed. To do so select Edit Item on the Toolbar.
Then click with the left mouse button on the text to be edited. A window will
appear with the original text in it. You can now alter it as necessary. When
finished either click with the left mouse button on something else to edit, or
click with the right mouse button.</p>

<p>Labels can be re-sized once placed by using the handles displayed around the
item or by using the tool dialogue normally displayed in the top right hand
corner of the drawing.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>No Connect</span></b></p>

<p>No connects indicate that the symbol, wire or power item is not connected to
anything else, and should not be connected to anything else. The electrical
rules checker will indicate an error if an input is unconnected unless it has a
no connect joined to it. Place no connects on any unused input or output to
avoid this error and indicate that it is intentionally left unconnected.</p>

<p>To place a no connect select this option, then move the cross to the
location in the design you where wish to place it and then click with the left
mouse button. When you have finished placing, either select a new tool or click
with the right mouse button. This will select the Edit Item in the Edit menu
for you.</p>

<p>No connects cannot be edited, but they can be moved or deleted.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Power</span></b></p>

<p>Power objects are use to show where power is connected to the design. All
power objects should have a value, which is the value of the power it provides
(such as 5V, GND, 0V etc.). All power objects with the same value are
considered connected to one another; even if they have different shapes.</p>

<p>You should connect wires to the power items at the end of their pins,
otherwise they will not be considered to be connected.</p>

<p>Certain symbols are automatically connected to power without the connection
being shown (for example the 7400, although no power pins are shown, it is
automatically connected to VCC and GND). When using these symbols, you should
make sure you use the same power supply names as the symbols otherwise the
symbol will not be correctly connected to the power supply.</p>

<p>To place power items in to your designs select power from the Toolbar. Then
in the dialogue box select the orientation of the power item, its shape and its
name. Place the power item by clicking with the left mouse button.</p>

<p>A range of shapes is provided, and you may use any name. Bars may be added
over letters in names in the same manner bars can be added to text and labels, by
placing ` before each letter that <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>requires a bar over it.</p>

<p>Once you have finished placing power items click with the right mouse button
or select a new tool.</p>

<p>Power items can be edited. To do so select Edit Item in the Edit menu. Click
with the left mouse button on the end of the power item's pin. You can now
change its name, orientation and shape. When finished either click with the left
mouse button on something else to edit, or click with the right mouse button.</p>

<p>Power items can also be move and deleted.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Wire</span></b></p>

<p>Wires are used to indicate connections on the circuit diagram. If you wish
to use features such as the electrical rules checker or net list generation
then you must use wires for this purpose. If you use lines instead of wires to
join up points on a diagram then these tools will not work!</p>

<p>Click with the left mouse button in the place you wish to start the wire.
Move to where you wish the wire to end and click with the left hand button
again. A wire segment will be placed and a new wire segment is now started from
this point.</p>

<p>If you prefer you can drag wires instead of using the clicking and then
moving. Simply drag with the left mouse button from the starting point to the
ending point. If the ending point is a symbol, another wire or a power item
then the wire will automatically snap to it and terminate at that point.</p>

<p>A wire will automatically snap to a placed symbol or another wire when moved
close to it. If you click with the left mouse button now, the wire will end at
the snapped point. You can turn this off by using the settings dialogue in the
Options menu.</p>

<p>When placing wires junctions will automatically be added when required.</p>

<p>To stop drawing click with the right mouse button, and you may start a new
wire from a different point. Clicking with the right mouse button again will
select the Edit Item option in the edit menu.</p>

<p>Normally the wire is locked to 90 degree positions. In this mode two line
segments are displayed at once. However, only one segment is placed at a time
when you click with the left mouse button. You must click once more to place
both the bus segments.</p>

<p>You may also lock to 45 degree angles only, or have no locking at all. This
can be selected from the edit window. When these options are used, only one
wire segment at a time is displayed.</p>

<p>If you find when you try and place two wire segments in rapid succession and
find that only one is placed, then the cause is properly due to the double
click speed of the mouse being setup so that it is too slow. Go to the Control
Panel and alter the double click speed faster. (See the Window's Manuals for
more details).</p>

<p>Wires cannot be edited, but they can be moved, dragged or deleted.</p>

<p>Wires can be repeated.</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Zoom</span></b></p>

<p>The zoom tool enables you to easily enlarge the view of the design. Once
selected you may enlarge the view by clicking with the left mouse button, and
reduce the view by clicking with the right mouse button.</p>

<p>The position of the mouse pointer, when you zoom in, is moved to the centre
of the window.</p>

<p>You may also use the scroll wheel to zoom.</p>
