# TinyCAD version 3.00.00

Here are the changes since 2.90.00:

## New Features:
- Keeps track of Netlist names & numbers so that when a netlist is re-generated the numbers do not change unless they have to
- Page dialogue now includes US Page Sizes
- Unfilled polygons can now be closed
- Allow polygons, circle and other shapes to have a fill but no line
- Allow free curves (not just quarter arcs) on polygons
- Dropped compiled help file in favour of a single HTML file for the manual, which can also be printed
- 

## Bug Fixes:
- Fix crashes in the Find dialogue
- Fix copy/paste in to applications such as Word which were coming out the wrong size


## Developers

Building TinyCAD should be easier than ever, as all the additional libraries are either included or installed directly from
Nuget.

- Switch to Visual Studio 2019 which should improve compatibility with Windows 10
- Use Nuget packages for pre-compiled libraries
